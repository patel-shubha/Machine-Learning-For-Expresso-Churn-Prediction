# Machine-Learning-For-Expresso-Churn-Prediction

## Introduction
Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of the competition is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood for a customer to churn - to stop purchasing airtime and data from Expresso.

Customer churn is the marketing term, which is used when an existing customer stops to buying a company's products or exit to use their services. When churn occurs, the customer chooses to cut his ties with the company. That's why churn usually is a huge problem for companies's marketing team. In this case, we define a churn customer as someone who is becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.

## Content
The data describes 2.5 million Expresso clients.

Train.csv - contains information about 2 million customers. There is a column called CHURN that indicates if a client churned or did not churn. This is the target. You must estimate the likelihood that these clients churned. We will use this file to train your model.

Test.csv - is similar to train, but without the Churn column. We will use this file to test your model on.
